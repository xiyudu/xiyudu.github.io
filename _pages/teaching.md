I aim to develop course materials that help students learn scientific computing alongside with theoretical concepts. This page hosts a collection of courses I have taught and GitHub repositories for the course materials.

If you have any question related to the course materials, please don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:xiyudu@hawaii.edu).
