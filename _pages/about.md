I am interested in soft materials design for the next generation.  Currently, I use a combination of theoretical and computational tools ranging from information theory to particle based simulations to design building blocks that self-assemble into intricate structures and perform functions just like in the movie Big Hero 6.

I will join the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as an Assistant Professor starting Jan. 1st, 2023.  Currently, I am a Research Associate working with Professor Michael Brenner at Harvard University.  Before that, I earned my Ph.D. in physics from University of Michigan, working with Professor Sharon Glotzer and Professor Greg van Anders.
<!-- Dr. Chrisy Xiyu Du is a research associate working with Professor Michael Brenner at Harvard University focusing on soft materials design. She grew up in Nanjing, China and first came to the United States as a high school exchange student. After the exchange year, she was inspired to come to the United States for college and went to Beloit College for undergraduate studies in physics and mathematics. She earned her PhD in physics from University of Michigan, working with Professor Sharon Glotzer and Professor Greg van Anders. Dr. Du has also been active in various diversity and outreach initiatives. She is currently on the DSOFT Membership committee and has co-organized a GSOFT March Meeting short course in 2019. She was on the Physics Department DEI Committee at University of Michigan and was a junior coach for the US Physics Team in 2016. -->
